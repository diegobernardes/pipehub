# PipeHub
The motivation for this project is based on my current need to keep the ongoing quantity of photos and videos generated by my family. With time, more and more of our most important files, in my opinion, are moving to the cloud, which bring benefits and also problems.

There are 2 core problems with cloud solutions, first, the ownership of the information. With cloud services, there's a big change that you are or gonna be the product. The other is the long term hability to keep the files. It's really easy to add but is also easy to delete files, and some files can't really be recovered like your wedding photos.
